## The smart way to be safe !

### Framework and libraries description

Lifechain.gr uses the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework with a combination of typescript and javascript. Next.js is a framwork optimized with the [react](https://react.dev/) library for the UI and [node](https://nodejs.org/en) for the API endpoints that can be also used to create a microservice. Next.js is currently the most popular framwork for web-applications thanks to the majority of libraries in npm. In our case we used 
1. framer-motion (Animation library)
2. Node-emailer (Email service)
3. chakra-ui (UI library)
4. Next-ui (UI library)
5. Icons from flaticon
6. i18n (Translation library)
7. react-intersection-observer (Auto drag)
8. Shape devider (svg generation for curves)
9. @svgr/webpack (Svg inmplimitatation from files)

Lifechain uses the page router for pages configuration and the creation of the api endpoints, mostly for the email and trasnlation services.

### Deployment and domain

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js project is from [Vercel](https://vercel.com), The company behind the framework itself ! It provides a simple enviroment to host the web-app and services to keep track with users experience. Just puss your project on github in a public repository, license it , create a vercel account and paste your github repository link !
